                    An <strong>aurora </strong> (plural: auroras or aurorae), also commonly known as the polar lights, is a natural 
                    light display in Earth's sky, predominantly seen in high-latitude regions 
                    (around the Arctic and Antarctic). Auroras display dynamic patterns of brilliant lights that 
                    appear as curtains, rays, spirals, or dynamic flickers covering the entire sky.
                    <br><br>
                    Auroras are the result of disturbances in the magnetosphere caused by the solar wind. Major 
                    disturbances result from enhancements in the speed of the solar wind from coronal holes and 
                    coronal mass ejections. These disturbances alter the trajectories of charged particles in the 
                    magnetospheric plasma. These particles, mainly electrons and protons, precipitate into the upper 
                    atmosphere (thermosphere/exosphere). The resulting ionization and excitation of atmospheric 
                    constituents emit light of varying colour and complexity. The form of the aurora, occurring 
                    within bands around both polar regions, is also dependent on the amount of acceleration imparted 
                    to the precipitating particles.

                <h3>Etymology</h3>
                <p>
                    The word "aurora" is derived from the name of the Roman goddess of the dawn, Aurora, who 
                    travelled from east to west announcing the coming of the sun. Ancient Greek poets used the 
                    corresponding name Eos metaphorically to refer to dawn, often mentioning its play of colors 
                    across the otherwise dark sky (e.g., "rosy-fingered dawn")
                </p>
                <h3>Occurrence</h3>
                <p>
                    Most auroras occur in a band known as the "auroral zone", which is typically 3째 to 6째 wide 
                    in latitude and between 10째 and 20째 from the geomagnetic poles at all local times 
                    (or longitudes), most clearly seen at night against a dark sky. A region that currently 
                    displays an aurora is called the "auroral oval", a band displaced by the solar wind towards 
                    the night side of Earth. Early evidence for a geomagnetic connection comes from the 
                    statistics of auroral observations. Elias Loomis (1860), and later Hermann Fritz (1881) 
                    and Sophus Tromholt (1881) in more detail, established that the aurora appeared mainly 
                    in the auroral zone.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Auroras seen within the auroral oval may be directly overhead, but from farther away, they 
                    illuminate the poleward horizon as a greenish glow, or sometimes a faint red, as if the Sun 
                    were rising from an unusual direction. Auroras also occur poleward of the auroral zone as 
                    either diffuse patches or arcs, which can be subvisual.
